                after = as.numeric(as.POSIXct("2021-01-01 14:00:00 UCT")))
df.markets1 <- cryptowatchR::get_markets(pair, params1, exchange = "kraken", route = "ohlc")
df.markets2 <- cryptowatchR::get_markets_as_df(pair, params2, exchange = "kraken", route = "ohlc")
df.markets3 <- cryptowatchR::get_markets_by_date(pair, params3, exchange = "kraken", route = "ohlc")
